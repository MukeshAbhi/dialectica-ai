## API Documentation

### Socket Events

#### Client → Server
- `requestRandomRoom` - Ask the server to find any available room 
- `joinRoom(roomId)` - Enter a specific room by its ID
- `sendMessage(message, roomId)` - Send a chat message to a room
- `checkRoomAvailability(roomId)` - Check if room exists and has space

#### Server → Client
- `chat-message` - A new message from your debate partner
- `system-message` - Receive system notifications
- `randomRoomFound(roomId)` - Notification of successful random room match
- `roomAvailabilityResponse` - Tells you if a room is available or full

### Why It Matters
These events make real-time chat and room matching possible. If you're contributing to the frontend or backend, understanding these will help you:
- Build new features like debate scoring or moderation
- Fix bugs related to room joining or message delivery
- Test socket connections during development

## Database Schema

The application uses Prisma ORM with the following main models:

- **User**: - Stores account info like name, email, and profile details
            - Linked to the rooms they join and messages they send

- **Room**: - Each room is a space for two users to debate
            - Tracks room name, status (active/inactive), and participants

- **Message**: - Stores every chat message sent in a room
               - Linked to both the user who sent it and the room it belongs to
               - Includes timestamps for when messages were sent
### How They Connect ?
- A User can join many Rooms
- A Room can have up to 2 Users
- A Message belongs to one User and one Room

## Roadmap (What's Done & What's Coming)

 ### Already Built
- Real-time Chat
- Room Matching
- Smart Room Limits
- User Login

### In Progress/ Planned
- [ ] AI-powered debate moderation
- [ ] User authentication and profiles
- [ ] Debate scoring and analytics
- [ ] Mobile app development
- [ ] Video/voice chat integration
- [ ] Tournament-style debates
